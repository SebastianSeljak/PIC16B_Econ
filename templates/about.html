	<h1> About the Project </h1>
	<p> 
		This site is an extension of our Business Survival Rate prediction project.
		<br>
		<br>
		
		Using the machine learning model we built, we built this application, which is designed for a user to input parameters of our input variables, which will then be applied to our model to generate an accurate prediction.
